# **PONG**

### a classic PONG game made from scratch using plain-old Python and Pygame!

I used a test-driven development process to make the game.
 _(Hooray for readable and maintainable code!)_
Python might not be the best for Object Oriented Programming, but hey, it works!


_still in development_
